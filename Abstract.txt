ABSTRACT

        In the fast-raced world of the today convenience and efficiency can be a major driving force and improvement to home quality of life. Voice activated smart assistants have transformed home automation beyond using a physical device to control appliances. This paper discusses the design of a cost-effective and user-friendly smart assistant which controls home appliances by taking voice commands. Its quick-reacting, voice-operated circuit — comprising an Arduino microcontroller, Elechouse’s Voice Recognition V3 module, and a 2-channel relay module — provides users with a convenient way to manage their lights and fans with nothing but their voice. Identifying the intention of the command, the system controls the relay that turns device on and off, with the Elechouse Voice Recognition V3. The Arduino works as the main controller to read the input from the voice module and control the relay and other devices according to the voice recognition result. This system provides a flexible, cost effective and highly capable smart home solution that is suitable for a large section of the population, suiting those who want to streamline their lives.
